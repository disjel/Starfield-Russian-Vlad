Makes Vladimir white.  Install with a mod manager or drop into your Starfield directory.  Russian Vlad.esm, Russian Vlad - Main.ba2, and Russian Vlad - Textures.ba2 should be in the Data folder.  Toggle the plugin in your mod manager or in the load order menu accessed though the Creations interface in the game.

If you are a plugins.txt user, then for the mod to work you may need to add the file to plugins.txt like so:

>\# This file is used by Starfield to keep track of your downloaded content.\
>*Russian Vlad.esm

Reupload and modify however you like.
